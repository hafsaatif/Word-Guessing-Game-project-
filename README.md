# Word-Guessing-Game-project-
A console-based Word Guessing Game in C++ that reads 10 words from a file and hides one in a 10x10 grid. The player guesses the word or takes a hint (shows word length). Words are placed randomly, and the game tracks the score. Includes a loop to replay. Uses file handling, arrays, and basic logic.
